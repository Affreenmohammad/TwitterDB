# Collecting Twitter data and storing in MongoDB
Here, we are collecting twitter data by creating a twitter account and app.
We use the authentication keys like consumer key, consumer secret,access token,access secret.
The port mentioned is similar to the port running in mongodb.
we create a database called "twitterdb" collection called "tweets". 
Through the mongodb console, we can view the tweets and count no.of tweets collected.
